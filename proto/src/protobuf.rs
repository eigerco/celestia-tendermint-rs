// Google protobuf Timestamp and Duration types reimplemented because their comments are turned
// into invalid documentation texts and doctest chokes on them. See https://github.com/danburkert/prost/issues/374
// Prost does not seem to have a way yet to remove documentations defined in protobuf files.
// These structs are defined in gogoproto v1.3.1 at https://github.com/gogo/protobuf/tree/v1.3.1/protobuf/google/protobuf

/// A Timestamp represents a point in time independent of any time zone or local
/// calendar, encoded as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at
/// nanosecond resolution. The count is relative to an epoch at UTC midnight on
/// January 1, 1970, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar which extends the
/// Gregorian calendar backwards to year one.
///
/// All minutes are 60 seconds long. Leap seconds are "smeared" so that no leap
/// second table is needed for interpretation, using a [24-hour linear
/// smear](https://developers.google.com/time/smear).
///
/// The range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. By
/// restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to and from [RFC
/// 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) date strings.
